 * Revision History:
 *
 *   $Log$
 *   Revision 1.6  1998/04/13 05:43:39  yosh
 *   Have fun recompiling gimp everyone. It's the great FSF address change!
 *
 *   -Yosh
 *
 *   Revision 1.5  1998/04/07 03:41:19  yosh
 *   configure.in: fix for $srcdir != $builddir for data. Tightened check for
 *   random() and add -lucb on systems that need it. Fix for xdelta.h check. Find
 *   xemacs as well as emacs. Properly define settings for print plugin.
 *
 *   app/Makefile.am: ditch -DNDEBUG, since nothing uses it
 *
 *   flame: properly handle random() and friends
 *
 *   pnm: workaround for systems with old sprintfs
 *
 *   print, sgi: fold back in portability fixes
 *
 *   threshold_alpha: properly get params in non-interactive mode
 *
 *   bmp: updated and merged in
 *
 *   -Yosh
 *
 *   Revision 1.4  1998/04/01 22:14:51  neo
 *   Added checks for print spoolers to configure.in as suggested by Michael
 *   Sweet. The print plug-in still needs some changes to Makefile.am to make
 *   make use of this.
 *
 *   Updated print and sgi plug-ins to version on the registry.
 *
 *
 *   --Sven
 *
 *   Revision 1.2  1997/06/18  00:55:28  mike
 *   Updated to hold length table when writing.
 *   Updated to hold current length when doing ARLE.
 *
 *   Revision 1.1  1997/06/15  03:37:19  mike
 *   Initial revision
